### Title: Classification of Customer Product Reviews Using Sentiment Analysis
### Description

We consider the problem of finding out the best techniques in classifying documents not by topic, but by overall sentiment, e.g., determining whether a review is positive or negative. Using novel reviews as data, we try to find out the combination of feature extraction, feature selection and machine learning methods which results in maximum accuracy. We also look at some new weighing schemes which we later find out, are more accurate than our traditional schemes. We conclude by suggesting the combination of tools which is likely responsible for optimum accuracy considering sentiment classification only.
